# Facebook
Well the only apps I use in this category are Whats App and Facebook website (I don't use the app as it want's access to too much information it doesn't need).

## Facebook Lite App
What can I say - it needs the following permissions:
- Calendar
  - Add/Modify calendar events and send emails to guests without owner's knowledge
  - Read calendar events and details
- Camera
  - Take pictures and videos
- Accounts
  - Read your contacts
  - Find accounts on th device
  - Modify your contacts
- Location
  - Access approximate location only in the foreground
  - Access precise location only in the foreground
- Microphone
  - Record audio
- Telephone
  - Directly call phone numbers
  - Read phone status and identity
- Storage
  - Modify or delete the contents of your shared storage
  - Read the contents of your shared storage
- Other
  - Download files without notification
  - Read phonbe numbers
  - Prevent phone from sleeping
  - View wi-fi connections
  - Receive data from the Internet
  - Access Google Play billing service
  - Send sticky broadcast
  - Set application badges
  - Connect and disconnect from wi-fi
  - Have full network access
  - retrieve running apps
  - android.permissions.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT
  - Advertising ID permission
  - Read locations from your media collection
  - Read sync settings
  - Run foreground services
  - Access Bluetooth settings
  - This app can appear on top of other apps
  - Control NFC
  - Run at start-up
  - Route calls through the system
  - View network connections
  - Use fingerprint hardware
  - Install shortcuts
  - Read Google service configuration
  - Control vibration
  - Toggle sync on / off
  - Use biometric hardware
  - Change network connectivity
  - Change audio settings
  - Pair with Bluetoot devices

Wow - When you start combining some of those settings, you have a very powerful application which could do things like:
- Add/Modify calendar events and send emails to guests without owner's knowledge = Self explanatory
- Download files without notification + Have full network access, could send out files to others on the network = Again, self explanatory
- Route calls through the system = all your calls could be routed through Facebook, at their end the audio is theirs to own.
- Prevent phone from sleeping + Record audio + Modify or delete the contents of your shared storage + Have full network access = Record any audio in range of the phone and send it to Facebook / AN Other.

An application with this much power is a BAD thing - Therefore, I am not using this.. But I still need to remove Facebook completely.
