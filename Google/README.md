# Google
Let's start with the worst of the worst.  Google, they track your every search, read your emails, scan your calendar and a million other things in order to build a profile on you, so they can then target you with advertising.  It's the equivalent of glancing in a shop window at a hat, then every shop from then on only sells hats. If I wanted a hat, I would have gone into the hat shop and purchased one; not the butchers, or the shoe shop.

So what do I use in relation to Google services? This will give me an indication as to alternatives I need to remove Google from my, and if you are reading this, your life.  The following are in alphabetical order.

## Android
Mental note - looking at Google Pixel phone with Graphene installed.  All the Android - none of the Google!


## Authenticator

Google Authenticator is an application which stores 2FA codes to allow you to secure accounts by not only asking for a password, but also a code which rotates every 60 seconds. The code is displayed on the Authenticator application.  See [2 Factor Authentication (2FA)](../README.md) .

So how do I use it?  Well it's really simple, I open the app, add an account and scan the QR code.  It adds the account to my Authenticator app along with a code that rotates every 60 seconds.  When I want to use it, I open the app and type the 6 digit code before the 60 seconds elapses into the website I want to authenticate with.

So I removed my first dependency on a Google product. Google Authenticator is no more and has been replaced by a product called [Authy](https://www.authy.com). It's a free app which allows you to authenticate via multiple devices.  You can install it via the Play Store on Android or via their website.

It's accessible via your phone number, so install it onto your mobile first, then onto your desktop.  It will send a message via Push Notification to the Authy app, which you can then accept.

It can add 2FA via QRCode, Barcode (via a plugin) or by typing in the key.

With the desktop application installed, you can authenticate directly from your desktop (something you cannot do with Google Authenticator). 

You can also set a master password and it will encrypt and backup your 2FA tokens for you.. Again, something not possible in Google Authenticator.

Give it a try - you won't be disappointed and you can take your first steps to removing a Google dependency.

## Browser / Chrome
Well this is an easy one - there are plenty of other browsers out there ranging from Chromium based (Chromium, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, etc.) to trusty old Firefox and beyond.

For me - this is a no brainer, Firefox is written by the Mozilla Foundation, which is a non-profit organisation who work to ensure the Internet stays a public resource.

Their [manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/about/manifesto/) works to ensure that the Internet remains a public resource and is not taken over by the deepest pockets. 

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/browsers/) is available on all platforms and has the title "Get the browsers that put your privacy first - and always have".

So switching from Chrome to Firefox was as simple as uninstalling Chrome and installing Firefox on Android and desktop.
