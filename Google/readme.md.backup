# Google
Let's start with the worst of the worst.  Google, they track your every search, read your emails, scan your calendar and a million other things in order to build a profile on you, so they can then target you with advertising.  It's the equivalent of glancing in a shop window at a hat, then every shop from then on only sells hats. If I wanted a hat, I would have gone into the hat shop and purchased one; not the butchers, or the shoe shop.

So what do I use in relation to Google services? This will give me an indication as to alternatives I need to remove Google from my, and if you are reading this, your life.  The following are in alphabetical order.

## Android
## Authenticator

## Browser / Chrome
Well this is an easy one - there are plenty of other browsers out there ranging from Chromium based (Chromium, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, etc.) to trusty old Firefox and beyond.

For me - this is a no brainer, Firefox is written by the Mozilla Foundation, which is a non-profit organisation who work to ensure the Internet stays a public resource.

Their [manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/about/manifesto/) works to ensure that the Internet remains a public resource and is not taken over by the deepest pockets. 

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/browsers/) is available on all platforms and has the title "Get the browsers that put your privacy first - and always have".

So switching from Chrome to Firefox was as simple as uninstalling Chrome and installing Firefox on Android and desktop.
