# Regain My Privacy
Plan / Software / Solution to regain my privacy online.

So here I am, 40+ and I have had enough of the Internet.  Well to be more accurate, I've had enough of Big Business (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft*) reusing my data, enough of Cookies tracking me from one site and trying to sell me stuff on another site. Enough of my phone tracking my every movement, analysing my every email, categorising my every photo and reasing my every document.

* I do see the irony of hosting this on GitHub when it's owned by Microsoft.

So - Here I go.. I am going to plan, document and attempt to execute De-[Insert company name here] my life.

As some of these systems just work collectively I want solution which works the same, or as near as damn it.
e.g. I take a photo on my Android and it is backed up to my Photo storage / Drive, which is then searchable.  I put a postcode into maps and I get directions to it from my current location.  I ask my home assistant to remind me, add to a list, etc and it appears in the relevant application.


# Google
Let's start with the worst of the worst.  Google, they track your every search, read your emails, scan your calendar and a million other things in order to build a profile.

So what do I need to remove Google from my, and if you are reading this, your life?

## Android
## Authenticator
## Browser / Chrome
## Calendar
## Documents / GSuite
## Drive
## Email
## Forms
## Hangouts
## Keep
## Search Engine
## Photos
## Play Store
## Voice
## YouTube


# Microsoft

# Facebook
Well the only apps I use in this category are Whats App and Facebook website (I don't use the app as it want's access to too much information it doesn't need).

## Facebook Lite App
What can I say - it needs the following permissions:
- Calendar
  - Add/Modify calendar events and send emails to guests without owner's knowledge
  - Read calendar events and details
- Camera
  - Take pictures and videos
- Accounts
  - Read your contacts
  - Find accounts on th device
  - Modify your contacts
- Location
  - Access approximate location only in the foreground
  - Access precise location only in the foreground
- Microphone
  - Record audio
- Telephone
  - Directly call phone numbers
  - Read phone status and identity
- Storage
  - Modify or delete the contents of your shared storage
  - Read the contents of your shared storage
- Other
  - Download files without notification
  - Read phonbe numbers
  - Prevent phone from sleeping
  - View wi-fi connections
  - Receive data from the Internet
  - Access Google Play billing service
  - Send sticky broadcast
  - Set application badges
  - Connect and disconnect from wi-fi
  - Have full network access
  - retrieve running apps
  - android.permissions.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT
  - Advertising ID permission
  - Read locations from your media collection
  - Read sync settings
  - Run foreground services
  - Access Bluetooth settings
  - This app can appear on top of other apps
  - Control NFC
  - Run at start-up
  - Route calls through the system
  - View network connections
  - Use fingerprint hardware
  - Install shortcuts
  - Read Google service configuration
  - Control vibration
  - Toggle sync on / off
  - Use biometric hardware
  - Change network connectivity
  - Change audio settings
  - Pair with Bluetoot devices

Wow - When you start combining some of those settings, you have a very powerful application which could do things like:
- Add/Modify calendar events and send emails to guests without owner's knowledge = Self explanatory
- Download files without notification + Have full network access, could send out files to others on the network = Again, self explanatory
- Route calls through the system = all your calls could be routed through Facebook, at their end the audio is theirs to own.
- Prevent phone from sleeping + Record audio + Modify or delete the contents of your shared storage + Have full network access = Record any audio in range of the phone and send it to Facebook / AN Other.

An application with this much power is a BAD thing - Therefore, I am not using this.. But I still need to remove Facebook completely.

# Additional

Additionally - The following are a must:
- VPN
- Password Manager
- AdBlocker
